# FriendFinder

## Description

  This application was created to design a simple friend/dating app. It uses frontend Javascript to submit a form and submit it to a javascript server on the backend. The backend then takes that information and returns the closest match based on the answers given in the quiz. 
  
  The app also has links to the basic API that it is using to store and calculate it's "Best match" from.
